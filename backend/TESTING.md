# Manual API Testing Guide

This guide provides curl commands to manually test all Discord-like chat backend endpoints.

## Prerequisites

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible

## Environment Variables

Set these variables for easier testing:
```bash
export BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000"
export API_URL="$BASE_URL/api"
export TOKEN=""  # Will be set after login
```

## 1. Health Check

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/health"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-08T...",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "database": "connected"
}
```

## 2. Authentication

### Register User 1
```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "testuser1@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "name": "Test User 1",
    "username": "testuser1"
  }'
```

### Login User 1
```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "testuser1@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123"
  }'
```

**Copy the token from response and set it:**
```bash
export TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"
```

### Register User 2 (for friend testing)
```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## Expected Response Codes

- **200**: Success (GET requests)
- **201**: Created (POST requests)
- **400**: Bad Request (validation errors)
- **401**: Unauthorized (invalid/missing token)
- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- **404**: Not Found
- **429**: Too Many Requests (rate limited)
- **500**: Internal Server Error

## WebSocket Testing

To test real-time features, you can use a WebSocket client and connect to:
```
ws://localhost:5000
```

Include authentication:
```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:5000', {
  auth: {
    token: 'your_jwt_token_here'
  }
});
```

## Error Responses

All errors follow this format:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": "Additional details if available"
}
```

## Notes

1. Replace placeholder values (USER_ID_HERE, FRIENDSHIP_ID_HERE, etc.) with actual IDs from previous responses
2. JWT tokens expire after 7 days by default
3. All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format
4. The fraud detection system automatically analyzes all messages
5. Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse
6. CORS is configured for localhost origins in development
